Scripts/source for configuration of the atom editor (https://atom.io)

Given my love/hate relationship with emacs, I've been looking for
something with the power and programmability of emacs without all
the historical cruft emacs just can't seem to move beyond. Github's
Atom editor is the closest thing I've found, and seems to be getting
the kind of popular attention needed to develop a good selection of
add-on packages.
