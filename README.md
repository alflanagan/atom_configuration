# Atom Configuration

Scripts/source for configuration of the atom editor (https://atom.io)

Given my love/hate relationship with [GNU
Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), I've been looking for something
with the power and programmability of Emacs without all the historical cruft
Emacs just can't seem to move beyond. Github's [Atom editor](https://atom.io) is
the closest thing I've found, and seems to be getting the kind of popular
attention needed to develop a good selection of add-on packages.

On the minus side, the scripting language is Javascript. The language is 
improving, but it's not Lisp.

I was including a list of the add-on packages I use with descriptions, but
it's too darn long and changes too often.

Needed: setup to store portable configuration settings in a file, merge
them with local config.json.
