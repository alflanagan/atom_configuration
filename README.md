Scripts/source for configuration of the atom editor (https://atom.io)

Given my love/hate relationship with [GNU
emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), I've been looking for something
with the power and programmability of emacs without all the historical cruft
emacs just can't seem to move beyond. Github's [Atom editor](https://atom.io) is
the closest thing I've found, and seems to be getting the kind of popular
attention needed to develop a good selection of add-on packages.

## Current Add-on Packages

These are the third-party packages I've found useful so far:

*  [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
   - Pulls together a bunch of code beautifiers, such as [js-beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify), runs the appropriate one for the current language environment.
*  atom-macros
*  atom-material-ui
*  buffer-pos
*  [character-table](https://atom.io/packages/character-table)
   - A nifty utility to let you specify a unicode value by name or code point, and insert it into the document.
*  clipboard-plus
*  color-picker
*  column-select
*  django-templates
*  editorconfig
*  file-icons
*  flex-tool-bar
*  git-diff-details
*  Hydrogen
*  hyperclick
*  js-hyperclick
*  last-cursor-position
*  linter
*  linter-coffeelint
*  linter-pylint
*  minimap
*  minimap-git-diff
*  minimap-linter
*  preview
*  project-manager
*  script
*  shell-it
*  shrink-whitespace
*  slickedit-select
*  sort-lines
*  tool-bar
